# license
- no license specified
- discussion of what it means here: https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/84720/which-license-can-protect-a-projects-owner-and-give-him-ownership-over-voluntee
- also github specifies no license policy here as well: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository#choosing-the-right-license
- TL;DR: contributions are open and encouraged, but just check in with me before using it on other platforms
